      "Groq API Response: Dinosaurs! Those magnificent, awe-inspiring creatures that ruled the Earth millions of years ago. Here's a brief overview of these incredible animals:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What were dinosaurs?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that dominated Earth's landscapes during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 million to 66 million years ago. The term \"dinosaur\" means \"terrible lizard\" in Greek, coined by scientist Sir Richard Owen in 1842.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Dinosaurs**\n",
      "\n",
      "There were over 1,800 known species of dinosaurs, ranging from small, feathered creatures to massive, long-necked sauropods. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tyrannosaurus Rex** (meaning \"king of the tyrants\"): A massive, meat-eating predator with powerful legs and a distinctive head crest.\n",
      "2. **Velociraptor** (meaning \"swift thief\"): A small, feathered carnivore with sharp claws and a deadly reputation.\n",
      "3. **Stegosaurus** (meaning \"roofed lizard\"): A plant-eater with a distinctive row of plates on its back and spikes on its tail.\n",
      "4. **Diplodocus** (meaning \"double beam\"): A long, slender herbivore with a small brain and a whip-like tail.\n",
      "5. **Spinosaurus** (meaning \"spiny lizard\"): A sail-backed carnivore with a spiny \"sail\" on its back and a long, narrow snout.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Characteristics**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinosaurs shared some common characteristics, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Scaly skin**: Dinosaurs had scaly, reptilian skin, often with feathers or quill knobs (where feathers attach).\n",
      "2. **Egg-laying**: Dinosaurs laid eggs, like modern reptiles.\n",
      "3. **Warm-bloodedness**: Many scientists believe dinosaurs were warm-blooded, meaning they could regulate their body temperature.\n",
      "4. **Diverse diets**: Dinosaurs had varying diets, including herbivory (plant-eating), carnivory (meat-eating), and omnivory (both).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Extinction**\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period, in an event known as the K-Pg extinction (65 million years ago). The exact cause of this extinction is still debated, but theories include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Asteroid impact**: A massive asteroid impact may have triggered a global cooling event, leading to the dinosaurs' demise.\n",
      "2. **Volcanic eruptions**: Huge volcanic eruptions could have released toxic gases, causing a prolonged \"winter\" that made it difficult for dinosaurs to survive.\n",
      "3. **Climate change**: Gradual changes in the Earth's climate may have made it difficult for dinosaurs to adapt and survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Legacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinosaurs have left an indelible mark on our imagination and culture. They continue to inspire art, literature, film, and scientific inquiry. Who knows? Maybe one day we'll discover a new species of dinosaur that will shed more light on these fascinating creatures!\n",
