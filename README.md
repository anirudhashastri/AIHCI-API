# Hello World with OpenAI API

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple "Hello World" generative task using the OpenAI API.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai



### 5. Reflection
For the reflection, I would discuss challenges like:
   - Understanding API authentication methods.
   - How to format prompts effectively for generative tasks.
   - What I learned about working with generative AI, particularly in crafting creative outputs from simple prompts.
   - How this knowledge could be applied in future projects like building chatbot interfaces or other creative applications.
